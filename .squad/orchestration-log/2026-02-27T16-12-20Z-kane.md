# Agent Spawn Log — Kane

**Date:** 2026-02-27T16:12:20Z  
**Agent:** Kane (Tester)  
**Role:** Test Analysis & Coverage Check  
**Mode:** background  
**Outcome:** ✅ completed  

---

## Task

Analyze test coverage and quality:
- Verify test pass rate and TFM coverage
- Identify missing test cases (integration, security)
- Flag untested critical code paths
- Assess dead code and pattern compliance

## Result

**Analysis delivered:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/kane-test-analysis.md`

**Verdict:** 66/66 tests passing (33 tests × 2 TFMs: net8.0, net10.0). Zero failures, zero skipped. All tests are unit-level.

**Coverage Gaps (High Priority):**
1. Pipeline has ZERO tests — RealtimeConversationPipeline needs ConverseAsync, ProcessTurnAsync, TrimHistory, disposal tests
2. QwenTTS has ZERO tests — no mirror of WhisperSpeechToTextClientTests pattern
3. DI builder extensions untested — UseSileroVad(), UseWhisperStt(), UseQwenTts() not verified

**Security Tests Missing:**
- Path traversal protection in ModelManagers exists but untested (../  and absolute path payloads)

**Code Issues:**
- SileroVadDetector._inferenceLock declared but never used (thread safety violation or dead code)

**Recommended Test Additions:**
1. RealtimeConversationPipelineTests (highest value)
2. QwenTextToSpeechClientTests
3. Path traversal tests for SileroModelManager and WhisperModelManager
4. DI builder extension tests
5. Fix or remove _inferenceLock
