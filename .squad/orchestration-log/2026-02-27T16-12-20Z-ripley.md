# Agent Spawn Log — Ripley

**Date:** 2026-02-27T16:12:20Z  
**Agent:** Ripley (Lead/Architect)  
**Role:** Architecture Review & Gap Analysis  
**Mode:** background  
**Outcome:** ✅ completed  

---

## Task

Analyze ElBruno.Realtime codebase architecture:
- Review core abstractions and pipeline design
- Validate M.E.AI pattern alignment
- Identify blockers for production use
- Document recommendations with priority

## Result

**Analysis delivered:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/ripley-architecture-analysis.md`

**Verdict:** Codebase is architecturally sound with solid abstractions. Clean M.E.AI alignment. All 33 tests pass on net8.0 and net10.0.

**Key Blockers Identified:**
1. Pipeline not multi-user safe (singleton conversation history) — blocks multi-session scenarios
2. No audio capture/playback helpers — developers must bring NAudio or equivalent
3. No integration tests for pipeline

**Actionable Recommendations:** 8 items prioritized (High/Medium/Low), ownership assigned to Dallas, Kane, and Lambert.
