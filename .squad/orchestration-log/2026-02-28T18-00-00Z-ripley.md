# Ripley — Issue #1 Triage & Work Decomposition

## Execution Summary

Completed full triage of Issue #1 ("Apply security, performance & CI hardening") with comprehensive decomposition into 4 domains (Security, Performance, CI, Squad AI). 

## What Was Done

### 1. Codebase Assessment
- Evaluated 5 security items → 2 ✅, 2 ⚠️, 1 ❌
- Evaluated 4 performance items → 0 ✅, 1 ⚠️, 3 ❌
- Evaluated 3 CI/Linux items → 2 ✅, 1 ⚠️
- Evaluated 1 Squad AI item → 0 ✅, 1 ❌

### 2. Work Decomposition
- **Domain 1 (Security):** 4 tasks (input validation, file integrity, test coverage, README)
- **Domain 2 (Performance):** 3 tasks (benchmarks, TensorPrimitives, allocation audit)
- **Domain 3 (CI):** 2 tasks (version validation, Squad CI)
- **Domain 4 (Squad AI):** 1 task (routing skill)

### 3. Execution Planning
- **Phase 1:** Parallel execution (Dallas security, Kane benchmarks, Parker CI, Ripley docs)
- **Phase 2:** Sequential (TensorPrimitives optimization after benchmarks)
- **Phase 3:** Optional (allocation audit if benchmarks justify)

## Deliverables

✅ Full triage document at `.squad/decisions/inbox/ripley-issue1-triage.md` with:
- Issue checklist assessment
- Overall priority matrix
- Work decomposition (all 10 tasks)
- Coordination plan with dependencies
- Risk analysis & mitigations
- Success criteria
- Timeline estimate (3–5 days)

## Impact

This triage unblocks parallel execution by 4 team members on independent domains. Clear success criteria and risk mitigations documented for implementation phase.

## Status

✅ COMPLETE — Ready for team assignment and execution (Phase 1).
