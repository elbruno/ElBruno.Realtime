# What We're Focused On

Critical production blockers fixed: thread-safety in SileroVadDetector, multi-user conversation isolation via per-session store. 80/80 tests passing (14 new). Both fixes approved by Kane. README updated with Agent Framework + MEAI attribution. Ready for merge.

**Remaining backlog from analysis:** QwenTTS streaming, integration tests, Blazor integration, error handling, sample naming, audio helpers (design tasks, not code).
